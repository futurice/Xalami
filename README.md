# Xalami
Nobody loves boilerplate, especially if feels like you rewrite it every time you start a new project. Xalami is a starting point for Xamarin Forms projects that includes a lot of elements you'll use in every project. It's also delicious!

Xalami is *lightweight* but *opinionated*. This means that we expect you to use the template as a starting point, and not a heavyweight framework that you must conform to. Xalami *does* however expect you to follow a few basic tenets:
- You app is based around an MVVM architecture
- You have a centralized navigation service
- You have one ViewModel per view, and a view corresponds roughly to a single "page" in your app
-  You use XAML to define your UI

Included in the project are such tasty goodies as:
- An emphasis on MVVM
- A simple localization framework based on .resx files
- A Navigation service which wraps a Xamarin Forms NavigationPage, support parameter passing, and navigation by View type or ViewModel type.
- Several useful XAML markup extensions
- An ItemsStack control
- And more!
